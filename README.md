about-me

La-02
Created an about me guessing game. One problem I ran into during this course was trying to access the counter to keep track of how many correct answers the user got. But beside that all went well for the guessing game itself

Lab-03

This lab we were assigned to create a guessing game and give ther user 4 attempts by prompting them to guess a number from 1-10 and if they do not guess the number after 4 attemps they will be prompted with the correct answer. Also inserting an array and using that array to carry answers inside of it and with that array ill use a loop and give the user 6 attemps to guess the answer and if they don't get it correct they are prompted with an alert after the 6 tries that they're attempts are up and the correct color is (inserted) along with all of the other options.
