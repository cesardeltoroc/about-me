        Hello, everyone my name is Cesar Deltoro. I grew up in the central valley of California and joined the Army right out of high school. I spent 4 years traveling and meeting new people and have gained first hand personal experince from serving. I like all things technology so I was confused on what I wanted to do until I started looking into coding. The output of writing words into a working website just happened to get my attention. I was in college but decided to do a bootcamp and now im here! I have always wanted to become a software developer.One of my favorite dishes is chicken Tikka Masala. And 
        finally my favorite color is Sky Blue.
